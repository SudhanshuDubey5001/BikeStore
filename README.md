# Bike Store data analysis

## Steps:
- Loaded data in MySQL Workbench using create and insert files. 
- Performed data cleaning and analysis using SQL commands in Bikestore_analysis.sql file.
- Exported final tables in csv format
- Loaded csv files in Tableau to create interactive charts and graphs to understand the data better.


## Conclusions after the data analysis: 
- The company was generating an excellent revenue with small growth in the years 2016 and 2017. However, there was a sudden spike in the revenue in the year 2018 in January and April in the sales of Trek ($362,239) and Electra($107,081) and then there was a questionable fall in June to $210 for Trek and $0 for Electra. Other models also fell to almost 0 dollar sales.
- Despite being the most expensive brand Trek, it sales were significantly higher than other brands.
- New York sales were significantly higher than other states - Texas and CA.
- The most popular models were 2016 in Mountain bikes and 2017 in Road bikes.
- Orders that were delivered within the same day generated the most revenue.
- The top customer was Melanie Hayes who spent $33,490 on Trek, Hurly and Surly bikes.

## Data driven suggestions:
- Find out the missing May, 2018 data and analyse what caused the sudden downfall in revenue.
- Research more about the Trek & Electra bikes and gather more data on the customer demographics (missing) to understand more about the targetted customers
- Advertise, promote and invest more in the Trek bikes and mountain bikes especially as it is the prime source generating product.
- Adjust the prices of bikes as it seems very unbalanced, especially the price hike of Heller brand in 2018.
- Open more stores in New York as data shows New York stores are the most popular.
- Offer incentives to the top 10 customers.
- Perform a focussed comparison between Trek and Electra and other brands that did not perform well based on quality checks, performance issues, customer complains, feedbacks etc.
